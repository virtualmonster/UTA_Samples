note: |
  We need to show that a module can change a variable value
  Currently such vars must be defined in the parent (hierarchy)
steps:
  - log: 'Within the status module. Status var value is ${STATUS}'
  - assign:
      vars:
        STATUS: 'Y'
  - log: 'Still within the status module. Status var value is now ${STATUS}'
