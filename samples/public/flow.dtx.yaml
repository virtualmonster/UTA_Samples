  Scripts can contain the flow steps "while", "until" and "if".
  A "pause" step can be used to create delays.
steps:
  - log: Lanch countdown
  - while:
      note: We decrement i by 1 within the condition expression
      condition: --i > 0
      steps:
        - log: 'T minus ${i}...'
        - if:
            condition: i==6
            steps:
              - log: We have a go for main engine start
        - pause: 1s
  - log: Booster ignition and liftoff!
  - until:
      condition: j > 8
      steps:
        - pause: 2s
        - assign:
            note: We increment j by 2 using a variable assignment
            vars:
              j: '${j+2}'
        - log: 'T plus ${j}...'
  - log: Booster separation complete
  - verify:
      - i == 0
      - j == 10
  - log: We have a successful launch
vars:
  i: '${11}'
  j: '${0}'
