note: "In a suite, quickFail attribute will skip furthur script executions once the\
  \ first failed verdict is encountered. This can speed up execution if it doesn't\
  \ make sense to continue if a single script failure is detected. Here, sleep-then-log.dtx.yaml\
  \ is never executed because quickFail is set."
