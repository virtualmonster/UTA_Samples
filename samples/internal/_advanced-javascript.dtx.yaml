  - log: if you define variables in the script blocks they leak - which is bad.
  - if:
      condition: |-
        (function() {
          let actual = "value";
          return EXPECTED == actual;
        })()
      steps:
        - log: You rang m'lord?
  - log: This way we haven't leaked the actual value
vars:
  EXPECTED: value
