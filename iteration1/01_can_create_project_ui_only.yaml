notes: |
  Macro is referenced by URL (relative in this case - but could as easily reference another file).
  The 'check focus on name' step should emit a warning at runtime 'Focus is not on name. Focused it to compensate'.
  We should provide a way of linting tests where the 'click on home' step causes a warning 'home is not accessible using a keyboard'.
  There is a password in plain text below... we can't do that, we need to provide a better approach
  The values here are default values only - so can be overridden.
  Notice there isnt a capital letter in sight.
  Notice words in value names are separated by underscore.
  Notice name, username, password not quoted but 'new project' is because it needs to be a single token.
  Notice for the time being the concepts are simple enough to embed them in yaml (formmatted by vscode), but the login ref is a comment in yaml - which is wrong.
steps:
  - do #login
  - press tab until focus on 'new project' button
  - press enter
  - check focus on name
  - type $project_name
  - press enter
  - click on home
  - check page contains $project_name
values:
  project_name: myproject
macros:
  login:
    steps:
      - open $deployment_url
      - check focus on username
      - type $username
      - press tab
      - check focus on password
      - type $password
      - press enter
    values:
      deployment_url: https://master-hcl.tp-k8s.nonprod.hclpnp.com
